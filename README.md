# Project Two: "Words in Motion"

by Nico Magat
DES 228, fall 2024

# Project Overview

The text that I chose for Project Two was the song "Close to You," by Frank Ocean. It is part of his 2016 album "Blonde." 

This song represents community to me because of the nostalgia that I feel when I listen to it.When I listen to it, I think of the passage of time and how/who I want to spend mine with. This song makes me think of the people around me whom I hold close to my heart.

# Technical Overview

This project showcases my technical skills in HTML and CSS.
This is a culmination of what I have learned in DES 228 so far.
